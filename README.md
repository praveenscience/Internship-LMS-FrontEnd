We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

Front End
<!--UL -->
* HTML & CSS(SCSS)
* Bootstrap 4 & Responsiveness
* JavaScript & ES6
* ReactJS & Node JS(lil bit for runtime)

Back End

* Node JS + Express JS
* Morgan + CORS & Node Mon
* PostgreSQL/MySQL

Deployment
* Husky 
* Netlify/Heroku
* Github Actions

>#### Important Note:
>
>The typical MERN Stack involves MongoDB + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB doesn't perform well under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two]. I hope this note helps people understand why we are not using MongoDB in MERN Stack.
