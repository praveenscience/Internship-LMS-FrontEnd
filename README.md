## About the Project

### Project Modules

The front end is open sourced, while back end is still closed for outside collaborators. This project contains multiple parts.

* Internship OnBoarding
* Project Management
* Learning Management System
* Certification Management
* Coupon & Payment Gateway

### Tech Stack

We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

* Bootstrap 5 for the Front End
* React JS with both Class & Functional Components
* Node JS & Express JS
* MySQL or PostgreSQL (yet to be decided)

> #### Important Note:
>
> The typical MERN Stack involves MongoDB + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB doesn't perform well under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two]. I hope this note helps people understand why we are not using MongoDB in MERN Stack.

### Project Landing Page: Winter of Code

I am currently building the landing page for the Winter of Code. It's going on in a steady state and I'll let everyone know as soon as possible once this is done! So far, I have got till here, I hope it looks good:
