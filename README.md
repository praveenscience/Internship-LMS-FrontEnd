We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

**Front End**

* HTML & CSS (using SCSS)
* Bootstrap 4 & Responsiveness
* JavaScript & ES6
* ReactJS & Node JS (lil bit for runtime)

**Back End**

* Node JS + Express JS
* Morgan + CORS & Node Mon
* PostgreSQL/MySQL

**Deployment**

* Husky 
* Netlify / Heroku
* Github Actions

> **Important Note:**
>
> The typical MERN Stack involves *MongoDB* + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB *doesn't perform well* under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use *MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL* (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two). I hope this note helps people understand why we are *not* using MongoDB in MERN Stack.
