# Internship OnBoarding Platform with Learning Management System

We are in the mission of solving a crisis for a lot of small and medium enterprises, who are trying to recruit interns for their projects. This platform aims to onboard new interns, who have applied to the companies and help them understand the process and make the transition smooth.

## About the Project

### Project Modules

The front end is open sourced, while back end is still closed for outside collaborators. This project contains multiple parts.

* Internship OnBoarding
* Project Management
* Learning Management System
* Certification Management
* Coupon & Payment Gateway

### Tech Stack

We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

* Bootstrap 5 for the Front End
* React JS with both Class & Functional Components
* Node JS & Express JS
* MySQL or PostgreSQL (yet to be decided)

> #### Important Note:
>
> The typical MERN Stack involves MongoDB + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB doesn't perform well under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two]. I hope this note helps people understand why we are not using MongoDB in MERN Stack.

### Project Landing Page: Winter of Code

I am currently building the landing page for the Winter of Code. It's going on in a steady state and I'll let everyone know as soon as possible once this is done! So far, I have got till here, I hope it looks good:
