[![DevTernShip Introduction](https://imgur.com/9gZXnnt.png)](https://rb.gy/cygmlf)

Created by the developers, for the developers and the enterprises, **DevTernShip** aims to automate a process that is usually beset by difficulties; The recruitment phase is riddled with disorientation and this makes it difficult for the onboarding interns to make heads or tails of the system.

Here's where **DevTernShip** jumps into the picture - *An Internship Onboarding platform with an innovative learning management system and intuitive performance tools*, we ensure that all is 'smooth sailing' when it comes to the talent pipeline. Moreover, Augmented efficiency is brought about with a simple and robust UI, thus rendering the experience even more dynamic.

## Introduction

The plight of small and medium companies has gravely wounded the world with serious consequences impacting all the onboard new interns, developers, full-time roles, and individuals during their recruitment phase. To solve these issues and to show a brilliant path to all the individuals listed we proudly present **DevTernShip**, a platform for Internship OnBoarding, Projects Management, Learning, Recruiting, and many more... for students, interns, developers, who are looking actively for Internship and full-time roles at the moment.

### Agenda

We are on the mission of resolving a crisis for a lot of small and medium enterprises, who are trying to recruit interns for their projects. This platform aims to onboard new interns, who have applied to the companies and help them understand the process and make the transition smooth. This platform is the best gateway to show recruiters, what interns are capable of.

### Easy OnBoarding

In this program we are going to have a setup for every individual intern by providing their account section, i.e., Profile, likely and show others that you are ready to work on a particular stack by joining their company as an Intern. To guide you better, we are also planning to introduce Learning pages, Application Tracking Systems, Opportunity Tracker, and Live Interactive Sections on YouTube by our well-qualified mentors to keep you updated.

### Bridging the Gap

This program helps the Intern to interact with the Recruiters & Managers, effectively by providing social media handles and also interns get a chance of exhibiting their work by sharing their GitHub, LinkedIn profiles with their recruiters.

### Couple of Favours

If you're interested, why not start with:

* Adding a Star :star: to this Repository
* [Subscribing to my YouTube Channel](https://rb.gy/fupw21), if you please?

### Motivation

- Automate the process which needs to be done regularly.
- Make the task easy and stress free of managment members.
- Save the time of people in doing same work multiple times.

### Methodology

We are following **Spotify Agile Methodology** to give the contributors an idea of efficient software development methods and how work is co-ordinated in the industry. If you don't know what that means, please refer [this blog](https://blog.praveen.science/my-experience-on-spotify-agile-methodology/). 

Following are some points on the methodology to be used:

* To get the best out of everyone contributing to this project, we have adopted _high alignment and high autonomy model_.
* The issues created will have a description of the problem to be solved, the contributors have to figure out how they would like to solve it and what tool they would like to use.
* Everything needs to be communicated to the scrum masters / project admin on what they think about a particular issue and its possible solution.
* We will have a sprint of one variable days week, based on the level of difficulty of the issue with regular sprint planning sessions and daily stand-ups to track the progress of each and every contributor.
* In these sessions, the scrum masters will take a note of the progress and blockers if any. If the contributor faces any issues / blocks, the others will help them solve it and resume their work. Hence, the blocks can be addressed timely.
* It would be a good idea to check out the [Git Standards followed in our way of Spotify Agile Methodology](https://blog.praveen.science/git-standards-followed-in-our-way-of-spotify-agile-methodolgy/) model.

We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

**Front End**

* HTML & CSS (using SCSS)
* Bootstrap 4 & Responsiveness
* JavaScript & ES6
* ReactJS & Node JS (lil bit for runtime)

**Back End**

* Node JS + Express JS
* Morgan + CORS & Node Mon
* PostgreSQL/MySQL

**Deployment**

* Husky 
* Netlify / Heroku
* Github Actions

> **Important Note:**
>
> The typical MERN Stack involves *MongoDB* + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB *doesn't perform well* under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use *MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL* (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two). I hope this note helps people understand why we are *not* using MongoDB in MERN Stack.

## FAQs

### General FAQs

#### What is an Open Source Project?

Open Source Project denotes the project's source code is free for anyone to use, study and modify. An Open Source community provides a great opportunity for aspiring programmers to distinguish themselves; and by contributing to various projects, developers can improve their skills and get inspiration and support from like-minded people. But most importantly, they can prove that they can build fantastic experiences that people love.

### Why is the `master` branch so important to not mess with?

The master branch is deployable. It is your production code, ready to roll out into the world. The master branch is meant to be stable, and it is the social contract of open source software to never, ever push anything to master that is not tested. If you make changes to the master branch while other people are also working on it, your on-the-fly changes will ripple out to affect everyone else and very quickly there will be merge conflicts. So, branching is a technique that gives a developer, group of developers the opportunity to create a new copy of a project without affecting the original, which is the master branch. This allows developers to experiment with a branch and if the experiment is successful, Git makes it easy to incorporate the experimental elements into the Master.
