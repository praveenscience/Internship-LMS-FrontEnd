## Introduction

The plight of small and medium companies has gravely wounded the world with serious consequences impacting all the onboard new interns, developers, full-time roles, and individuals during their recruitment phase. To solve these issues and to show a brilliant path to all the individuals listed we proudly present **DevTernShip**, a platform for Internship OnBoarding, Projects Management, Learning, Recruiting, and many more... for students, interns, developers, who are looking actively for Internship and full-time roles at the moment.

### Agenda

We are on the mission of resolving a crisis for a lot of small and medium enterprises, who are trying to recruit interns for their projects. This platform aims to onboard new interns, who have applied to the companies and help them understand the process and make the transition smooth. This platform is the best gateway to show recruiters, what interns are capable of.

### Easy OnBoarding

In this program we are going to have a setup for every individual intern by providing their account section, i.e., Profile, likely and show others that you are ready to work on a particular stack by joining their company as an Intern. To guide you better, we are also planning to introduce Learning pages, Application Tracking Systems, Opportunity Tracker, and Live Interactive Sections on YouTube by our well-qualified mentors to keep you updated.

### Bridging the Gap

This program helps the Intern to interact with the Recruiters & Managers, effectively by providing social media handles and also interns get a chance of exhibiting their work by sharing their GitHub, LinkedIn profiles with their recruiters.

We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

**Front End**

* HTML & CSS (using SCSS)
* Bootstrap 4 & Responsiveness
* JavaScript & ES6
* ReactJS & Node JS (lil bit for runtime)

**Back End**

* Node JS + Express JS
* Morgan + CORS & Node Mon
* PostgreSQL/MySQL

**Deployment**

* Husky 
* Netlify / Heroku
* Github Actions

> **Important Note:**
>
> The typical MERN Stack involves *MongoDB* + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB *doesn't perform well* under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use *MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL* (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two). I hope this note helps people understand why we are *not* using MongoDB in MERN Stack.
