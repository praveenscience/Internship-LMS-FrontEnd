[![DevTernShip Introduction](https://imgur.com/9gZXnnt.png)](https://rb.gy/cygmlf)

Created by the developers, for the developers and the enterprises, **DevTernShip** aims to automate a process that is usually beset by difficulties; The recruitment phase is riddled with disorientation and this makes it difficult for the onboarding interns to make heads or tails of the system.

Here's where **DevTernShip** jumps into the picture - *An Internship Onboarding platform with an innovative learning management system and intuitive performance tools*, we ensure that all is 'smooth sailing' when it comes to the talent pipeline. Moreover, Augmented efficiency is brought about with a simple and robust UI, thus rendering the experience even more dynamic.


## Introduction

In a world where small and medium companies struggle, countless interns, developers, and job seekers face challenges. Enter DevTernShip, a beacon of hope bridging the gap between aspiring professionals and the companies that need them.

DevTernShip is more than a platformâ€”itâ€™s a revolution. Students and interns find their perfect match and real-world projects to hone their skills. Developers and job seekers connect with companies ready to invest in their potential.

Companies benefit too, focusing on growth without recruitment hassles. DevTernShipâ€™s resources keep teams at the cutting edge.

Welcome to DevTernShipâ€”where career dreams are nurtured, skills are sharpened, and futures are crafted with care. Join us and be part of a story where every chapter leads to success.

### Agenda

We are on the mission of resolving a crisis for a lot of small and medium enterprises, who are trying to recruit interns for their projects. This platform aims to onboard new interns, who have applied to the companies and help them understand the process and make the transition smooth. This platform is the best gateway to show recruiters, what interns are capable of.

### Easy OnBoarding

In this program, we are going to have a setup for every individual intern by providing their account section, i.e., Profile, likely and show others that you are ready to work on a particular stack by joining their company as an Intern. To guide you better, we are also planning to introduce Learning pages, Application Tracking Systems, Opportunity Tracker, and Live Interactive Sections on YouTube by our well-qualified mentors to keep you updated.

### Bridging the Gap

This program helps the intern, interact with the Recruiters & Managers, effectively by providing social media handles. Also, the interns get a chance to exhibit their work by sharing their GitHub, LinkedIn profiles with their recruiters.

### Couple of Favours

If you're interested, why not start with:
* Adding a Star :star: to this Repository
* [Subscribing to my YouTube Channel](https://rb.gy/fupw21), if you please?

### Motivation

- Automate the process which needs to be done regularly.
- Make the task easy and stress-free for the employers.
- Save the time of people in doing the same work multiple times.

### Methodology

We are following **Spotify Agile Methodology** to give the contributors an idea of efficient software development methods and how work is coordinated in the industry. If you don't know what that means, please refer to [this blog](https://blog.praveen.science/my-experience-on-spotify-agile-methodology/). 

Following are some points on the methodology to be used:

* To get the best out of everyone contributing to this project, we have adopted _high alignment and high autonomy model_.
* The issues created will have a description of the problem to be solved, the contributors have to figure out how they would like to solve it and what tool they would like to use.
* Everything needs to be communicated to the scrum masters / project admin on what they think about a particular issue and its possible solution.
* We will have a sprint of one "variable days" week, based on the level of difficulty of the issue with regular sprint planning sessions and daily stand-ups to track each contributorâ€™s progress.
* In these sessions, the scrum masters will take note of the progress and blockers if any. If the contributor faces any issues / blocks, the others will help them solve them and resume their work. Hence, the blocks can be addressed timely.
* It would be a good idea to check out the [Git Standards followed in our way of Spotify Agile Methodology](https://blog.praveen.science/git-standards-followed-in-our-way-of-spotify-agile-methodolgy/) model.

We are primarily considering JavaScript (sorry, not TypeScript) as the base language. We are using MERN Stack for this, where the tech stack consists of:

**Front End**

* HTML & CSS (using SCSS)
* Bootstrap 4 & Responsiveness
* JavaScript & ES6
* ReactJS & Node JS (lil bit for runtime)

**Back End**

* Node JS + Express JS
* Morgan + CORS & Node Mon
* PostgreSQL/MySQL

**Deployment**

* Husky 
* Netlify / Heroku
* Github Actions

> **Important Note:**
>
> The typical MERN Stack involves *MongoDB* + ExpressJS + ReactJS + NodeJS. But, if you consider our product, it really needs a hierarchical database management system and not a document oriented one. MongoDB *doesn't perform well* under a lot of situations, so we're planning to use *MySQL (or MariaDB) or PostgreSQL* (We have already mentioned that it's yet to be decided between these two). I hope this note helps people understand why we are *not* using MongoDB in MERN Stack.

## Installation & Running

**System Requirements**

For Server Side Setup / Development Environment:

 * Google Chrome: Add 'React Developer Tools' from chrome extensions. It allows to inspect the React component hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools.
 * Git: Our project uses Git as a version control system. 
 * NodeJS: This allows to run JavaScript on a computer/server. It allows us to create, read, update, and delete files on the server side.
 * Visual Studio Code: This is the text-editor for our project as we are using React, it provides right extensions to support our React JS development. Add these extensions for ReactJS development - 
   * ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets 
   * GitLens - Git supercharged 
   * Git History
   * ESLint 
   * Prettier - Code formatter
   * PostMan: This software used as a REST Client to create and execute queries. 

For running on the Client Side:

* A modern browser that supports localStorage & Single Page Applications:
  * Google Chrome
  * Mozilla Firefox
  * Microsoft Edge (Blink Engine)
* As this project **doesn't** use polyfills, legacy browsers aren't supported.

```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:


```
git clone "your-cloned-link here"
```


 Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd desktop
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>
```
For example:

```
git checkout -b add-new-file
```

(The name of the branch does not need to have the word _add_ in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open add or edit file in a text editor. Add code for any existing algorithm in other language or add some new algorithms. Make sure to update correspond README.md file if needed. Now, save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add "name of the file you add or edit"
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add message for the change"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```

replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Contribute` button. Click on that button.

click on `Open pull request`.

click on `Create pull request`.

## FAQs

### General FAQs

#### What is an Open Source Project?

Open Source Project denotes the project's source code is free for anyone to use, study and modify. An Open Source community provides a great opportunity for aspiring programmers to distinguish themselves; and by contributing to various projects, developers can improve their skills and get inspiration and support from like-minded people. But most importantly, they can prove that they can build fantastic experiences that people love.

### Why is the `master` / `main` branch so important to not mess with?

The `master` / `main` branch is deployable. It is your production code, ready to roll out into the world. The `master` / `main` branch is meant to be stable, and it is the social contract of open source software to never, ever push anything to `master` / `main` that is not tested. If you make changes to the `master` / `main` branch while other people are also working on it, your on-the-fly changes will ripple out to affect everyone else, and very quickly there will be merge conflicts. So, branching is a technique that allows a developer, group of developers to create a new copy of a project without affecting the original, which is the `master` / `main` branch. This allows developers to experiment with a branch and if the experiment is successful, Git makes it easy to incorporate the experimental elements into the `master` / `main`.

### About GSSOC

#### What is GSSOC?

GirlScript Summer of Code is the 3 months long Open Source program during every summer conducted by GirlScript Foundation, started in 2018, intending to help beginners get started with Open Source Development while encouraging diversity. Throughout the program, participants contribute to different projects under the guidance of experienced mentors. Top participants get exciting goodies and opportunities.

#### Where to ask for help?

* You can message on the respective channel of a project or directly message the owner or mentors of the repository on Discord or LinkedIn.
* You can email the mentors or the admin.

### About DevTernShip
